    <h4 class="mb-2">Getting to Afghanistan</h4>

    <h5 class="mt-3">By Air</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan is accessible by several international airports, with Hamid Karzai International Airport (KBL) in
        Kabul being the main gateway. Other cities such as Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat also have international airports
        offering regional and limited international connections. Major airlines provide flights to and from key
        destinations in the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia. With ongoing development and increasing tourism
        interest, air connectivity is steadily improving.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">By Land</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan shares land borders with Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Travelers
        can enter the country through various border crossings, including Torkham (from Pakistan), Islam Qala (from
        Iran), and Hairatan (from Uzbekistan). Entry requirements vary depending on nationality, so visitors should
        ensure they have valid visas and check local border policies before arrival.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">By Road</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan's road network connects major cities and neighboring countries. While most international visitors
        arrive by air, overland travel is possible for those coming from surrounding countries. Routes such as the
        Kabul–Jalalabad Highway and the Ring Road link key regions, but travelers are advised to stay updated on road
        conditions and safety advisories before planning cross-border trips.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-3">By Rail and Sea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan currently does not have passenger railway or sea entry points, as it is a landlocked country.
        However, freight railways exist at border towns like Hairatan and Torghundi for trade purposes. Travelers should
        rely on air or land routes for entering the country.
    </p>

    <hr class="my-4">

<h4 class="mb-2">Getting to Afghanistan from Neighboring Countries and Provinces</h4>

<p class="mb-1">
    Afghanistan is connected to several neighboring countries through a network of highways, border crossings, and bus routes. While air travel is the most common method for international visitors, regional overland access is possible via Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. Roads link major cities like Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kandahar, and Jalalabad to border towns and neighboring countries.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">By Road from Neighboring Countries</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>From Pakistan:</strong> Use the <em>Torkham border crossing</em> to enter Jalalabad, or the <em>Spin Boldak crossing</em> for access to Kandahar. These routes are frequently used and connect to main highways within Afghanistan.</li>
    <li><strong>From Iran:</strong> The <em>Islam Qala border</em> provides direct access to Herat via Highway 1 (the Ring Road), which links to other cities.</li>
    <li><strong>From Uzbekistan:</strong> The <em>Hairatan border crossing</em> leads to Mazar-i-Sharif and the north via the A76 highway.</li>
    <li><strong>From Tajikistan:</strong> Enter through the <em>Shir Khan Bandar crossing</em> for access to Kunduz and the northeastern provinces.</li>
    <li><strong>From Turkmenistan:</strong> The <em>Torghundi border</em> connects to Herat province, commonly used for trade and freight travel.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="mt-3">By Road within Afghanistan</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Afghanistan's primary cities are connected via the Ring Road (AH76 and AH77), linking Kabul to Herat, Kandahar, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Jalalabad. Travel times can vary depending on road conditions and security updates. Major inter-city routes include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Kabul to Jalalabad:</strong> Approximately 150 km via the Kabul–Jalalabad Highway (NH08); takes around 2.5 to 3 hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Kabul to Mazar-i-Sharif:</strong> Around 425 km via the Salang Pass; travel time is 7–9 hours depending on weather and traffic.</li>
    <li><strong>Kabul to Herat:</strong> Via Ring Road, approximately 820 km; overland journey takes more than 12 hours, often done in stages.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="mt-3">Intercity and Provincial Bus Services</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Several bus companies and minivan services operate between major Afghan cities and provincial centers. While not as formalized as in some countries, shared taxis and regional vans are widely used by locals and travelers alike. Key routes include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Kabul to Jalalabad – departs from Pul-e-Charkhi Terminal</li>
    <li>Kabul to Herat – often via Kandahar for safety and rest stops</li>
    <li>Mazar-i-Sharif to Herat – via Sheberghan and Maymana</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-1">
    Travel costs are relatively affordable, typically ranging from 200 to 1000 AFN per person depending on distance and vehicle class.

<h4 class="mb-2">Getting Around Afghanistan</h4>

<h5 class="mt-3">Public Transport in Afghanistan</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Public transport in Afghanistan varies by city and region. In larger cities like Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Kandahar, minivans, shared taxis, and buses are commonly used for commuting. While the system isn’t centralized like major metro systems in other countries, transportation is generally affordable and widely used by locals.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">How to Pay for Transport</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Most public transport options in Afghanistan are paid in cash. There is currently no nationwide travel card system like Dubai’s nol card. Fares are usually inexpensive, and prices are either fixed or negotiable depending on the vehicle type and destination.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">City Minibuses and Vans</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    In cities like Kabul and Herat, minibuses and vans follow fixed routes and are among the most popular and budget-friendly options. These vehicles typically operate throughout the day and cost as little as 10 to 20 AFN for short distances. They are often marked by destination signs in the windshield.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Shared Taxis</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Shared taxis are widely available and can be found in most cities and towns. These taxis operate on set routes and fill up with passengers heading in the same direction. Prices are low compared to private taxis and are agreed upon before the journey starts.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Private Taxis and Ride-hailing</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Private taxis can be hired on the street or through local taxi stands. While Afghanistan currently doesn’t have widely-used ride-hailing apps like Uber, some local services in Kabul and Herat are emerging. Private taxis are more expensive than shared options but offer convenience and comfort.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Car Rentals</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Car rental services are limited but available in cities like Kabul. International visitors must present a valid international driving permit (IDP). Due to varying road and security conditions, it's advised to rent vehicles with local drivers familiar with the region.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Cycling and Walking</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    Walking is common for short distances in urban and rural areas, particularly in bazaars and residential zones. While Afghanistan is not yet a bike-friendly country on a national level, cycling is increasing in popularity in some areas, especially among young people and sports enthusiasts. There are currently no formal bike rental systems, but personal bike usage is growing.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Long-distance Travel</h5>
<p class="mb-1">
    For intercity travel, shared taxis and regional buses are common. They connect major cities like Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Jalalabad. Travel can be lengthy due to terrain and road conditions, so planning ahead and using reliable transport providers is essential.

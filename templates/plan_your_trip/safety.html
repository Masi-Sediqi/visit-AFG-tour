    <h4 class="mb-2">All About Safety in Afghanistan</h4>
    
    <p class="mb-1">
        Safety in Afghanistan varies widely depending on region, time, and local conditions. While certain areas —
        particularly major cities like Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Herat — have become more stable and are receiving more
        domestic and international visitors, it is important for travelers to stay well-informed and follow local
        guidelines. Always check current travel advisories issued by your home country before visiting.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-1">
        Local law enforcement and community elders play key roles in maintaining order. Visitors are advised to stay in
        reputable accommodations, avoid risky areas, and travel with local guides when possible. Taking personal
        responsibility and showing respect for Afghan customs and security protocols will help ensure a safe and enjoyable
        visit.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Staying Safe on the Roads and Driving in Afghanistan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Road safety is a major concern in Afghanistan, especially outside of main cities. Roads can be narrow, unpaved, and
        affected by weather or poor visibility. If you plan to rent or drive a car, you must carry an international driving
        license and understand local traffic norms.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Seat belts are encouraged, although not always enforced. Always drive cautiously and defensively, and avoid
        traveling at night or in remote areas without local guidance. Traffic enforcement may vary, so it's important to
        follow the rules and remain calm in all situations.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Staying Safe Around Water</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        While Afghanistan is a landlocked country, there are popular local spots for swimming and picnicking along rivers
        and lakes, such as Band-e-Amir in Bamyan, Qargha Lake near Kabul, and other reservoirs. These natural sites can be
        beautiful but may lack formal safety supervision.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Visitors should avoid swimming alone, especially in fast-moving water or unfamiliar areas. Always check with locals
        about safety conditions and avoid swimming during or after rainfall due to water flow changes and hidden hazards.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Staying Safe While Hiking in Afghanistan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan offers breathtaking hiking opportunities in places like Panjshir Valley, Bamyan, and Nuristan. If you're
        planning a trek, always travel in groups, inform someone about your route, and ideally go with a local guide.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Carry plenty of water, sun protection, warm clothing for sudden temperature changes, and wear proper hiking
        footwear. The best time for hiking is during spring and autumn when the weather is mild. Avoid hiking alone or in
        restricted/military zones.

    <h4 class="mb-2">Staying Safe in the Afghan Mountains and Deserts</h4>
    
    <p class="mb-1">
        A journey through Afghanistan’s rugged landscapes — from the deserts of Nimruz to the majestic mountains of Bamyan and Panjshir — can be a breathtaking experience, but preparation is essential. Daytime heat can be intense in arid regions, while temperatures may drop significantly at night. If you plan to camp or stay in remote areas, bring warm clothing, plenty of water, non-perishable snacks, and a first aid kit. It’s strongly advised to coordinate trips with local guides or trusted tour operators familiar with the terrain and security situation.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Protect Yourself from the Sun</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghanistan’s climate offers abundant sunshine, particularly in central and southern provinces. To avoid sunburn and dehydration, wear sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-protective sunglasses. Always carry extra water, especially when visiting high-altitude areas or traveling in spring/summer. Between 11 AM and 3 PM, seek shade where possible to avoid peak sun intensity.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">What to Do in a Medical Emergency</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        In case of a medical emergency, dial <strong>112</strong> to request ambulance services. Be ready to explain your location clearly; if you’re in a remote area, reference a nearby village, mosque, market, or known landmark. While English may not be spoken fluently, assistance is often available in Dari and Pashto. In larger cities like Kabul, Herat, or Mazar-i-Sharif, private hospitals such as FMIC or Cure International can offer higher standards of care.
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Tips for First-Time Visitors to Afghanistan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        Afghan society is deeply respectful and rooted in traditional values. Visitors are encouraged to observe local customs and laws for a respectful and enjoyable stay. Here are some tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dress modestly in public — long sleeves and loose-fitting clothes are preferred. Women should wear a headscarf in most areas.</li>
        <li>Public displays of affection are discouraged and may be considered offensive.</li>
        <li>Always ask permission before taking photos of people, especially women or security personnel.</li>
        <li>Respect local prayer times and avoid loud behavior near mosques or religious gatherings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5 class="mt-3">Afghanistan Police Contacts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1">
        In case of emergencies, contact Afghan National Police by dialing <strong>119</strong>. For non-urgent matters or tourist assistance, you may also reach out through local police stations, often located near main town centers. Use mapping apps like Google Maps to find the closest post if you're in a city. In rural areas, contact may need to be made through local elders or community leaders.

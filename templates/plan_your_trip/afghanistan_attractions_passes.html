            <p class="card-text">
              An <strong>Afghanistan Heritage Pass</strong> is a proposed tourism initiative that would allow visitors to explore Afghanistan's most iconic cultural and historical sites while saving money.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Instead of paying separately at each location, travelers could purchase a pass granting access to multiple attractions ‚Äî with potential savings of up to 60%.
            </p>
  
            <h5 class="mt-4">üïå Possible Included Attractions:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>National Museum of Afghanistan (Kabul)</li>
              <li>Babur‚Äôs Gardens</li>
              <li>Darul Aman Palace</li>
              <li>Herat Citadel</li>
              <li>Bamiyan Valley and Buddhas</li>
              <li>Blue Mosque ‚Äì Mazar-i-Sharif</li>
              <li>Band-e-Amir National Park</li>
            </ul>
  
            <h5 class="mt-4">üéüÔ∏è Two Types of Passes Could Be Offered:</h5>
            <p><strong>1. Fixed Attractions Pass:</strong> Choose 3 to 7 attractions and visit them anytime within your trip duration. Ideal for short stays or focused visits.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Unlimited Cultural Pass:</strong> Visit as many sites as you like within 3, 5, or 7 consecutive days. Perfect for regional or cultural explorers.</p>
  
            <h5 class="mt-4">ü§ù In Practice:</h5>
            <p>
              While this system is not officially available in Afghanistan yet, such an initiative could help simplify tourism, boost cultural preservation, and provide better access to travelers.
              For now, visitors can arrange bundled site visits through tour operators or cultural NGOs.
